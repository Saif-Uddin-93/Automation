<p>
I'm emailing you to arrange a collection for your IT equipment.<br>
What we'll need is:<br>
<ul>
<li>Address to collect from</li>
<li>Contact number</li>
<li>List of IT to collect</li>
<li>Best date/time to collect (Not including Fridays if collecting from outside London)</li>
</ul>
Please ensure the IT is packaged safely to minimise any risk of damage.<br>
Couriers may refuse collection if not adequately packaged.<br>
Once we have all the necessary information, a courier will come collect as scheduled.<br>
</p>
Thanks,<br>
