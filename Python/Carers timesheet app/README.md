#Video File Management tool

## Purpose
This app was created to manage the video file produced by my front door camera. It specifically kept the videos of the scheduled times of when my dad's carers would visit to keep track of: who came, what time they arrived and what time they left.

## Functionality
The app has buttons which creates the new folders according to: the date and the time of day. Then the video files for that day would be renamed with easier to read naming convention then deleted if they were not part of the required time ranges. The remaining files are moved to the corresponding folders for the current date.
